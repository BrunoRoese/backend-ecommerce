# Welcome to my ecommerce website!

<p>The database and project idea is based on udemy course Full Stack: Angular and Java Spring Boot E-Commerce Website
, however the course doesn't cover the backend part, at least at the start. So I implemented my own backend</p>

<h4>This project is for study purpose, feel free to give me any advise and tips, thank you :D</h4>

<h4>Still on version 1.0</h4>

<p>Using SpringBoot and Maven (Spring security coming soon)</p>
<p>Using JPA for object relational mapping and other stuff</p>
<p>Lombok to keep things clean</p>
<p>MySql for data base</p>
<p>Hamcrest, Junit and Mockito for unit testing</p>

<h3>Next steps:</h3> 
<p>Implement security and user authentication</p>
<p>Implement new sales controller, for that I need to implement new tables at my database</p>
