# Welcome to my ecommerce website!

<p>The database and project idea is based on udemy course Full Stack: Angular and Java Spring Boot E-Commerce Website
, however the course doesn't cover the backend part, at least at the start. So I implemented my own backend</p>

<h4>This project is for study purpose, feel free to give me any advise and tips, thank you!!</h4>
<h5>Feel free to contribute with the project, for more information, please read git workflow section</h5>

<h4>Still on version 1.0</h4>

<p>Using Java 11 for this project</p>
<p>Using SpringBoot(2.6.3) and Maven(1.0) (Spring security coming soon)</p>
<p>Using Spring Data JPA for object relational mapping</p>
<p>Using Lombok</p>
<p>MySql for SQL DB</p>
<p>Junit(5.8.2) and Mockito(4.3.1) for unit testing</p>

<h3>Next steps:</h3> 
<p>Implement security and user authentication</p>
<p>Implement new sales controller, for that I need to implement new tables at my database</p>

<h3>Git Workflow:</h3>
<p>Currently working with 2 fixed branches, to update one of them you will need to open an Pull Request and be approved by me.
Develop is for testing purpose and is a pre-main branch, when opening a PR to main branch, use the prefix main/{branch-name} 
and do a cherry-pick with your commits.</p>
